# Navigation and Routing sample code

Sample code for [Learning Flutter's New Navigation and Routing System][article],
an article explaining Navigator 2.0.

## Samples

**Navigator 1.0 samples**

* `nav_1/anonymous_routes.dart` - Shows how to use a Navigator to push and pop
  anonymous routes (e.g. MaterialPageRoute)
* `nav_1/named_routes.dart` - Shows how to use define named routes via the `routes`
  parameter on MaterialApp, and navigate using Navigator.pushNamed
* `nav_1/on_generate_route.dart` - Shows how to handle arbitrary named routes
  using the `onGenerateRoute` callback defined in the `MaterialApp` constructor.

**Navigator 2.0 samples**

* `nav_2/pages.dart` - Shows how to define a list of [Page] objects on Navigator
  declaratively.
* `nav_2/router.dart` - Full sample that shows a custom RouteInformationParser
  and RouterDelegate parsing named routes and declaratively building the stack
  of pages for the Navigator.


**Advanced**

* `nav_2_advanced/nested_router.dart` - Shows two [RouterDelegate], one nested
  within the other. A [BottomNavigationBar] can be used to select the route of
  the outer RouterDelegate, and additional routes can be pushed onto the inner
  RouterDelegate / Navigator.
* `nav_2_advanced/transition_delegate.dart` - Shows how a custom
  TransitionDelegate can be used to customized when transition animations are
  shown.
