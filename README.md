[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/samples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/samples)

A collection of open source samples that illustrate best practices for
[Flutter](https://flutter.io).

This repo will be getting significantly larger as Flutter progresses toward 1.0.

## Index

A simple app that deserializes a set of JSON strings using three
different libraries: `dart:convert`, `json_serializable`, and `built_value`.
